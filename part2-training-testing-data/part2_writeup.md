# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the previous model as it loop sthrough of the values of the xtest dataset, creating a figure that is able to show the training, testing, and the data provided.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The coefficent tells me that there is a moderate positive correlation at 0.587, meaning it is not extremely strong but there is some correlation.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say this model is leaning more accurately, having a closer difference between the actual and predicted value than the previous model.
