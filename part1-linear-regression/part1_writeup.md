# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is the correlation value of the graph, meaning that this linear regression model has a slightly positive correlation.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure for a perosn who is 42 years old is around 137.46
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
This data could be seen as generally accurate, but it only has a very limited amount of samples, limited the generalizability of the model. The best way to improve the model is to add more samples throughout a wide variety of population, increasing the accuracy of the results and the line of best fit.
