# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Red Group: Overspenders. They spend lots of money whilst having a generally low average income.
Blue group: Mature spenders. They don't spend much money whilst having an overall low average income.
Green group: Frugal. They have higher average incomes, but don't spend much money anyways.
Purple group: Average Joes. They have a completely average income, as well as a completely average spending score.
Orange group: Plain rich. High spending, and high income means they are very rich.
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
They would be in the frugal group (green) likely, as they have low spending but as they have a medium income they wouldn't be included in the mature spenders (blue) group.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
One specific cluster of interest would be the mature spenders group. Seeing as they are low income and therefore don't spend too much, creating a product that is reliable, applicable to many things, and has longetivity would be the primary focus, as typically this group would focus on more practical, cheaper, and longer-lasting products.
